Cuber
==============================================================================

Cuber is a Rubik's cube simulator written in javascript with a little bit of three.js thrown in for good measure. It uses CSS 3D transforms and has a programmatic API, and has different rendering outputs.

I am using this open source project for my Rubik's cube solver. Thanks to the [Chrom Cube Lab](https://www.chrome.com/cubelab)

Take a look at the [basic example](/index.html). This demonstrates many of the api settings.
